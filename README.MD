# Mock Socket Server

### How to use:

* Clone repository
* `cd` into top level folder
* run `npm install`
* You will need to provide credentials to the Pusher constructor via the Dotenv module. Please contact me for the credentials or create your own with Pusher.
* run `npm start`

###### Please contact me for env credentials or any questions.

btw, I just realized that I should have mentioned that you already contributed to the design with feedback! I'll make sure to next time.
